%This script is an intermediary that will attempt to make .mat files for
%any new subjects. We used to run makeTrustIDList, but this pulls from box,
%which is where all the subjects data is eventually stored, but not where
%new subjects are stored. Therefore I suggest makeTrustIDList only be used
%if trust_ids becomes corrupted or deleted.

%NOTE: for behaviour subjects only put the raw data files into folders and
%run this command with trust_ids= new subject id's. There shouldn't be a
%lot of them.
